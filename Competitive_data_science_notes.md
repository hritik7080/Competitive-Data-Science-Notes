## Facts:
- Linear Model splits space into 2 subspaces with a hyperplane.
- Tree-based methods splits spaces into boxes and use constant the predictions in every box.
- KNN methods heavily rely in how to measure points "closeness". The assusmption is close objects are likely to have same labels. It heavilyrelies in how to measure point closeness.
- Feed forward NNs produce smooth non-linear decision boundary. 
- The most powerful methods are GBDT and NNs. but not always.

## Difference between RandomForest and ExtraTrees models
ExtraTrees classifier always tests random splits over fraction of features(in contrast to Random Forest, which tests all possible splits over fraction of features.) That's why they are called extra/randomized trees.

## Imp. points regarding trees
- In random forest, if we drop first and last tree, the model we average 100 similar performing trees, trained independently. So the order of trees does not matter in RandomForest and performance drop will be very similar on average.
- In GBDT if we drop first and last tree, the  model we have sequence of trees, each improve predictions of all previous. So, if we drop first tree â€” sum of all the rest trees will be biased and overall performance should drop. If we drop the last tree -- sum of all previous tree won't be affected, so performance will change insignificantly (in case we have enough trees). case1 performance will drop more than in the case2.
- In a Random forest, each tree in forest is independent from the others, so two RF with 500 trees is essentially the same as single RF model with 1000 trees.
